# Smart Calculator

## 📝 Project Overview
Developed an intelligent calculator that can recognize handwritten equations from images, process them, and compute results accurately. The system utilizes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and machine learning to enhance calculation efficiency.

## 🔹 Features
- **Handwritten Equation Recognition**: Uses OCR (Tesseract) to extract text from images.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Captures equations from live images and processes them instantly.
- **Mathematical Expression Solver**: Utilizes NumPy for accurate calculations.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive UI for input and results display.
- **Multi-Format Input**: Supports typed equations as well as handwritten input.

## 📌 Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, Tesseract OCR, NumPy, Tkinter (for UI)
- **Concepts**: Image Processing, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Machine Learning

## 📂 How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install opencv-python pytesseract numpy`.
3. Run `calculator.py` to start the application.
4. Upload an image or capture one using a webcam.
5. View the extracted equation and computed result.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Improve OCR accuracy for handwritten text.
- Add voice input support for solving equations.
- Implement a mobile-friendly version for enhanced usability.
